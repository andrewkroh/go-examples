This is an incomplete project to build a rust library that can validate the data
types contained in an index mapping against ECS data types.

This would be compiled into a web-assembly library and published to NPM so that
it could be used in a standalone web-page that can validate mappings of your
ES server without needing to share credentials with any third-party servers.
